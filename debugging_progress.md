# Debugging Progress: Manga Chapter Fetching Issue

This document tracks the debugging process for the issue where manga chapters are not being fetched correctly.

## Initial Problem

- **Symptom:** The application reports "No chapters available" even when chapters exist on MangaDex. The user has clarified that this happens regardless of the language filter selected.
- **User Suspicion:** The user suspected an issue with the API endpoint being used to fetch chapters, mentioning the `GET /chapter` endpoint from the MangaDex documentation.

## Debugging Steps & Changes

### Current Implementation (`/manga/{id}/feed`)

- The current implementation in `src/api/manga_chapters.ts` uses the `GET /manga/{id}/feed` endpoint.
- This is the implementation that is resulting in the "No chapters available" error.

### Past Attempts

1.  **Switch to `/chapter` endpoint:** An attempt was made to switch to the `GET /chapter` endpoint. This was reverted at the user's request after it caused other errors.
2.  **Add `order` parameter:** An attempt was made to add an `order: { chapter: 'desc' }` parameter to the `/manga/{id}/feed` endpoint call. This was also reverted at the user's request to pause code changes.

## Current Status

- **Code changes are paused.**
- The code has been reverted to its original state, using the `GET /manga/{id}/feed` endpoint without any extra parameters.
- The primary focus is to analyze the problem and document potential solutions before implementing them.

## Next Steps

- **Analysis Phase:**
    - Re-investigate the `fetchChaptersByMangaId` function in `src/api/manga_chapters.ts`.
    - Analyze the exact API request being sent by `axios`, including the URL and headers.
    - Manually craft and send the same request using a tool like `curl` or Postman to compare the response.
    - Thoroughly review the MangaDex API documentation for the `/manga/{id}/feed` endpoint, paying close attention to all required and optional parameters.
